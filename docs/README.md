# TechNet v2

Moving a community of passionate people to a better place.

This project is an experiment in moving the content and functionality of the world's greatest collaboration platform to a better host.

This is a copy of my own articles [tagged with PEJL](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/tags/PEJL/default.aspx) on TechNet Wiki.

I have also included the User Pages from TechNet Wiki.

Behind this repo is an Azure Function sentinel, which periodically polls the repo.

After every poll, the sentinel writes it's status to [this file](/Wiki/blob/master/logs/WikiSentinelStatus.json).


**GitHub Pages**

[THESE PAGES ARE HOSTED HERE(https://technet2.github.io/Wiki)
